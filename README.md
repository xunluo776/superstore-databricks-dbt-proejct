# Superstore Sales & Profit Analysis  
_A Modern Lakehouse Project using Databricks, dbt & the Superstore Dataset_  

## 🚀 Project Overview  
This project demonstrates a full end-to-end **Data Engineering pipeline** built on the modern **Lakehouse architecture**.  
Using the popular Superstore retail dataset, it showcases ingestion, transformation, and analytics — all orchestrated on Databricks with dbt for modular SQL modeling.  

**Key outcomes include:**  
- Month-over-month sales and profit growth tracking  
- Regional contribution to profit over time  
- Segment-level profitability (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office)  
- Discount vs profit-margin analysis for category optimization

## 🧩 Technologies & Architecture  

| Layer | Tool / Framework | Purpose |
|-------|------------------|----------|
| **Ingestion** | Databricks Jobs + Auto Loader | Load raw Superstore data into Bronze tables |
| **Transformation** | dbt Core (`dbt-databricks` adapter) | Stage and model data into Silver/Gold layers |
| **Storage** | Delta Lake on Databricks | Reliable, ACID-compliant data storage |
| **Analytics** | Databricks SQL Views & Visualizations | Derive business insights and reporting tables |
| **Version Control** | GitHub | Manage code, models, and documentation |

This project follows the **Bronze → Silver → Gold** architecture pattern for clean, scalable data modeling.

## 🛠️ How to Run the Project  

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/xunluo776/superstore-databricks-dbt-proejct.git
   cd superstore-databricks-dbt-proejct/dbt
   ```

2. **Configure Databricks connection in `profiles.yml`**
   ```yaml
   default:
     target: dev
     outputs:
       dev:
         type: databricks
         catalog: hive_metastore
         schema: dbt_luo_gold
         host: <your-databricks-host>
         http_path: <your-sql-endpoint>
         token: <your-databricks-token>
   ```

3. **Run dbt commands**
   ```bash
   dbt deps
   dbt seed --full-refresh
   dbt run
   dbt test
   ```

4. **Explore in Databricks SQL**  
   Use the created `superstore_analysis` views to build visuals and dashboards.

## 📈 Example Insights  

- The **Consumer segment** contributed nearly half of total profit.  
- The **West region** frequently ranked as the top monthly profit driver.  
- Higher discounts correlated with reduced profit margins, especially in Office Supplies.  

---

## 🧠 Future Enhancements  
  
- Integrate **GitHub Actions** for automated CI/CD of dbt models.  
- Expand **data quality monitoring** and **documentation** via dbt docs.  
- Build a polished **BI dashboard** (Power BI / Tableau / Databricks SQL) to showcase results.
